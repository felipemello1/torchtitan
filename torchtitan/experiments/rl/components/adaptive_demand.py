"""Demand rule of the adaptive rollout buffer: how many prompt groups may be in the pipeline.

Words
-----
group        one prompt with its N sampled answers. Everything here is counted in groups.
P            groups the trainer consumes per training step.
ready        finished groups waiting to be trained on (the shelf). The next batch of P is cut from them.
generating   groups still producing answers (waiting for a generator, or in flight).
demand       how many groups the buffer may hold at once: generating + ready + the batch being trained. The one
             number this rule decides, at every step start.
stall        the trainer arrives at a step start and fewer than P groups are ready: it waits.
rejected     a finished group whose answers all got the same reward; thrown away on arrival. The "untrainable
             share" is the fraction of finished groups rejected.
policy age   of a trained group: training steps between its generation and its training.

The rule
--------
At a step start, `demand - ready` of the slots hold groups that are not ready. Call that `unavailable`. The trainer
stalls when fewer than P groups are ready, so the demand that would have avoided a stall at that step is exactly
`unavailable + P`. Keep the last `lookback_steps` values of `unavailable` and set

    demand_needed = P + quantile(unavailable over the last lookback_steps, 1 - stall_probability) + 1

then move `damping_factor` of the gap toward it, the same going up and down. `+ 1` is one spare group. Nothing is
assumed about how long groups take: the count already contains everything (slow groups, refills of rejected
groups, a workload getting slower).

`unavailable` is a sum of one "not finished yet" coin flip per group in the buffer, so it is close to normal whatever
the distribution of generation times. The quantile is read off a normal fitted to the window, `mean + t x sd`,
where `t` is the Student-t prediction multiplier for the next value given `lookback_steps` samples (1.92 for 10
samples at 95%). It uses every point of the window and can exceed the largest value seen.

Demand never exceeds the mean-age ceiling: by Little's law the buffer may hold A batches of trainable groups plus
the batch in training, plus the slots the rejected groups occupy while they generate,

    ceiling = A * P + P + generating * untrainable_share

with A = `target_offpolicy_steps` if given, else `max_offpolicy_steps`. When the ceiling binds the trainer may stall
rather than train on older data; a log line says so.

Example (P = 8, lookback 10, stall probability 5%):

    unavailable over the last 10 step starts = [44, 46, 41, 48, 45, 47, 50, 43, 46, 45]
    mean 45.5, sd 2.55, t = 1.92                 ->  quantile = 45.5 + 1.92 x 2.55 = 50.4 -> 51
    demand_needed = 8 + 51 + 1 = 60
    demand was 64 -> half the gap: 64 - ceil(4 x 0.5) = 62

@dataclass
class StallDrivenDemand:
    """Demand = P + quantile of the unavailable count + 1, a share of the gap per step, under the mean-age ceiling.

    Args:
        num_prompts_per_train_step: P, groups the trainer consumes per step.
        max_offpolicy_steps: A, the hard limit on policy age; the buffer drops groups older than this. Without a
            target below, it is also the mean age the ceiling holds under.
        target_offpolicy_steps: optional. If given, the MEAN policy age is held at or under it, at the cost of
            stalling: demand is capped at the mean-age ceiling for this age. None: the ceiling is applied at
            `max_offpolicy_steps`.
        lookback_steps: how many of the most recent step starts the quantile is taken over; older values are forgotten.
        stall_probability: the share of steps allowed to stall; the quantile is taken at 1 - stall_probability. This
            is what the rule aims for when nothing else limits the demand. It cannot be met when the age ceiling or
            the generators' capacity caps the demand below what the workload needs, and it assumes some finished
            groups are trainable.
        start_batches: demand at the first step, in batches of P; the rule learns the rest from the run itself.
        damping_factor: how much of the gap between the current demand and `demand_needed` is closed per step, up
            or down alike. 0.5 moves half the way each step; 1.0 jumps straight to `demand_needed`.

    The name: the rule is driven by what the trainer would have stalled on. `demand - ready` at a step start is the
    number of groups that were not there for it; the rule sizes the buffer for the value that number stays under.

    Example:
        demand = StallDrivenDemand(num_prompts_per_train_step=8, max_offpolicy_steps=10)
        demand.demand                                                       # -> 24: three batches to start
