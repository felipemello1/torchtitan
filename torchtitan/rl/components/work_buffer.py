    Each entry is a RolloutGroupWork moving WAITING -> INFLIGHT -> FINALIZED. An active-slot budget caps
    the pipeline at `max_active_rollout_groups` active slots. With `window_size=None`, the batcher takes
    the oldest finalized group anywhere in the buffer. A finite `window_size` restricts it to a look-ahead
    range anchored at the oldest entry.

    For details on the buffer's callers, check the diagram in the controller.py file.

    NOTE: a work slot is **NOT** released when marked as FINALIZED or taken by the batcher.
    Instead, it is only released on `release_active_groups` calls by the trainer
    or data filtering. This is done this way so that we can guarantee we never have more
    than `max_active_rollout_groups` in the entire pipeline (buffer+queue+training).
    Otherwise, we would produce born-stale examples.

class AdaptiveRolloutGroupWorkBuffer(RolloutGroupWorkBuffer):
    """Oldest-ready buffer with exact age eviction and a demand learned from the run.

    Same callers and lifecycle as `RolloutGroupWorkBuffer`; three rules differ:

    1. Demand. At every step start the buffer counts the groups that are not ready (generating, or the batch
       being trained) and hands the count to `StallDrivenDemand`: demand = one batch + the value that count stays
       under on 95% of steps + one spare group, moved up half the gap or down one group per step, never above the
       mean-age ceiling (see `adaptive_demand.py`). Generator capacity ``C`` stays a separate deployment limit that
       admission enforces, so demand cannot enlarge vLLM concurrency.
    2. Selection. `take_finalized` returns the oldest FINALIZED group wherever it sits; a slow group never
       blocks younger finished ones and keeps its slot until it finishes.
    3. Age. A finalized group that would be consumed more than `max_offpolicy_steps` versions after it was
       claimed is dropped (slot released at once, prompt not retried); with `max_offpolicy_steps=None` nothing is
       dropped. The mean age is held under `target_offpolicy_steps` if set, else under `max_offpolicy_steps` if
       set, by the demand ceiling, at the price of stalls when the workload needs more groups than the ceiling
       allows. With neither, the demand follows the workload alone.
