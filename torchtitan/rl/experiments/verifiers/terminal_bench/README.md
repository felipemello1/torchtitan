# Terminal-Bench with Verifiers and TitanRL

This experiment trains a Qwen3.5 terminal agent (9B or 35B-A3B) on a Harbor dataset
and validates it on the 89 Terminal-Bench 2.1 tasks. TitanRL schedules rollout
groups, generates tokens and trains the model; Verifiers 0.3.1 runs the Terminus-2
agent and the Harbor verifier, through the existing bridge in
`torchtitan/rl/examples/verifiers/`. Only the task adapter, the recipes and their
tests live here; TitanRL's core is unchanged.

## Run

Install the TorchTitan RL dependencies and this directory's `requirements.txt` in one
Python 3.12 environment (Verifiers 0.3.1 needs MCP 1.x), and let the user run Docker
on the controller host. By default (`TERMINAL_BENCH_SANDBOX=docker`) the agent runs
**inside** the task's container, so do not use `SubprocessConfig` for untrusted tasks.

```bash
export TERMINAL_BENCH_TRAIN_DATASET=org/train-tasks@<ref>
export TERMINAL_BENCH_EVAL_DATASET=org/terminal-bench-2-1@<ref>

python -m torchtitan.rl.train \
  --module torchtitan.rl.experiments.verifiers.terminal_bench \
  --config rl_grpo_qwen35_9b_terminal_bench
```

The recipes read the checkpoint from `torchtitan/rl/example_checkpoint/`; to load it
from elsewhere, set `hf_assets_path` in your own config function
(`torchtitan/config/README.md`). TitanRL's CLI defaults to a single host; placing the
meshes across hosts needs a caller-provided `HostMeshes` launcher.

## Run without Docker on the controller

`TERMINAL_BENCH_SANDBOX=sandoq` is for a controller that cannot run the task images,
such as an aarch64 host (85 of the 89 Terminal-Bench 2.1 images are amd64-only). The
agent then runs **outside** the sandbox, and only its commands cross over:

```text
controller, env-server worker                          Sandoq Firecracker VM (x86)
  AgentOutsideHarness --chat--> GenerationServer
      | each bash tool call
      +-- runtime.run(["bash", "-lc", command]) -----> podman task container
                                                       (tests/test.sh grades here)
```

The agent is a bash-tool loop (`../agent_outside.py`), not Terminus-2, so its prompt
format differs from the Docker path. The runtime is `vf.PrimeConfig`; the
`sandoq_provider` package from `ram_prime_rl` (`extensions/sandoq`, with its pinned
`sandoq-client`) rebinds it to Sandoq's OCI runner and reads its settings from the
environment. The recipe fails at config time without the first two:

```bash
export VF_SANDBOX_PROVIDER=oci-runner
export OCI_RUNNER_TASK_NETWORK=host  # test.sh installs pytest; without it every reward is 0
export TERMINAL_BENCH_SANDBOX=sandoq
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/ram_prime_rl/extensions/sandoq:$PYTHONPATH
export OCI_RUNNER_ENVIRONMENT=oci-runner-firecracker-medium
export OCI_RUNNER_TOKEN_FILE=/path/to/firecracker-token  # mode 0600
export OCI_RUNNER_POOL_SIZE=128  # the recipe runs 8 x 16 rollouts at once
export OCI_RUNNER_ECR_REGISTRY=168653207203.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
export OCI_RUNNER_ECR_UCLOUD=ucloud  # or OCI_RUNNER_ECR_TOKEN_FILE=/path/to/ecr-password
```

Each task starts in its image's `WORKDIR`, read from its Dockerfile, since Harbor
parses none and a Sandoq session fails when its workdir is missing.

Without a readable token file every rollout ends in `SandboxError` with zero turns.
The rollout error only says the OCI runner pool broker "did not bind"; the broker's
own traceback in the controller log names the token file.

## Datasets

Tasks come from Harbor datasets selected by id, the usual Verifiers way: the `harbor`
CLI downloads `org/name[@ref]` into `~/.cache/harbor` on first use. Pin `@ref` and
record it with the checkpoint; the 2.0 and 2.1 benchmarks are not interchangeable.

- `TERMINAL_BENCH_EVAL_DATASET`: Terminal-Bench 2.1 (89 tasks), validated at the start
  and end of training.
- `TERMINAL_BENCH_TRAIN_DATASET`: a separate dataset to train on. It must differ from
  the benchmark and its task ids should be disjoint. This example does not fetch,
  filter or publish training examples.

Each task must declare a pullable `[environment].docker_image`; a task with only a
Dockerfile is rejected rather than evaluated in the wrong environment. Not every
published image ships `tmux`; Terminus-2 installs it when it is missing.

**The task container needs outbound network at scoring time, or every reward is
silently 0.** Each Terminal-Bench 2.1 `tests/test.sh` installs its own toolchain
(`apt-get`, `uv`, then pytest from PyPI), and ends in `if ...; then echo 1; else echo
0; fi`, which exits 0 whether the tests passed, failed or were never installed.
Without egress the grader writes a `0` that looks like a real score. Docker's default
bridge network has egress; an isolated runtime or a host without it breaks scoring.

## Recipes

Both recipes share the datasets and these settings: 65,536-token context, 16,384
generated tokens per turn, 120 agent turns, 8 groups of 32 samples per step, 4 target
off-policy steps, 100 steps, constant learning rate 1e-6, fp32 master weights with
bf16 FSDP compute, full activation checkpointing and a DCP save every 20 steps.
Terminus-2 uses the XML parser without context summarization (`harness.py`). Timeouts
are 7,200 s for the agent and 12,000 s for scoring (sized for the installs above); the
tasks' own timeouts are ignored. The binary task reward goes through TitanRL's
ordinary advantage and GRPO path.

| Model | Config | Trainer | Generators | Generator CUDA graphs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Qwen3.5-9B | `rl_grpo_qwen35_9b_terminal_bench` | FSDP=8 | 8 x 1 GPU | `FULL_DECODE_ONLY` |
| Qwen3.5-35B-A3B | `rl_grpo_qwen35_35b_a3b_terminal_bench` | FSDP=4, TP=2, EP=8 | 2 x 4 GPUs (DP=2, TP=2, EP=4) | off |

Each uses 16 GPUs: 8 for the trainer and 8 for generators.

- **35B-A3B layout.** The model has 2 KV heads and 256 experts, so TP is at most 2,
  trainer EP must be at least TP and divide both the experts and `dp_shard * tp`, and
  the generator's DP axis exists only to supply expert-parallel ranks (EP = DP x TP).
- **fp32 master weights** are the default. For the 35B-A3B that is about 70 GB of model
  states per trainer GPU before activations, so it needs GPUs with well over 80 GB.
  With `dtype="bfloat16"` and a 1e-6 learning rate most updates round away: in a quick
  check with weight standard deviation 0.02, about 2% of weights change per step.
- **CUDA graphs are off for the 35B-A3B generator.** The standard MoE token dispatcher
  copies all-to-all split sizes to the host, and graph capture fails on that copy.
  Re-enable capture together with a dispatcher that avoids the host read.
- **The 35B-A3B recipe has not been run end to end.** The CPU tests check that its
  layout fits the model's KV heads and experts, not that it fits in memory or that
  rollouts complete.

`TrainingSampleBuilder.drop_zero_std_reward_groups` is `True` and the reward is
binary, so a group whose 32 samples all score 0 is discarded. With a base model that
solves nothing every group is dropped, no batch forms, and the run waits in
`wait_for_training_batch` without reaching a second step. That looks like slow
rollouts; check the model's pass rate on a few tasks first.

## Known gaps

- Verifiers 0.3.1 has Docker and Prime runtimes but no Daytona.
- Verifiers does not build task Dockerfiles, so Dockerfile-only tasks need a prebuilt
  image.
- Datasets are fetched by Harbor id. A cluster without access to the Harbor Hub can
  pre-populate `~/.cache/harbor` with an exported task tree; loading from an arbitrary
  local path is not supported here.
- Harbor grading returns `0.0` when the grader never ran, which is indistinguishable
  from a task the agent failed: `HarborTask._graded` discards `test.sh`'s result and
  the reward-file readers swallow their exceptions. Treat a run of uniform zeros as
  unexplained, not as a capability measurement.
- TitanRL does not read `Trace.metrics`, so per-rollout metrics from a taskset cross the
  process boundary and are dropped without a warning.
- Verifiers' Harbor fixture staging restores host file ownership, which fails in a
  rootless container with unmapped host IDs.
- Verifiers' built-in Terminus-2 config does not expose the XML parser and summary
  policy, so `harness.py` patches them into the upstream program; exposing those knobs
  in Verifiers would remove the adapter.
- Mainline TitanRL supports GRPO, not DPPO. Validation reports greedy pass@1 only.
