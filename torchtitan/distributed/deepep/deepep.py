"""
DeepEP v2 primitives for MoE Expert Parallel, on the unified ``ElasticBuffer`` API.

DeepEP v2 (>= 2.0.0) collapses the v1 two-path design -- high-throughput (HT,
``buffer.dispatch``/``combine``) and low-latency (LL,
``buffer.low_latency_dispatch``/``combine``) -- into a SINGLE ``dispatch``/``combine``
on ``deep_ep.ElasticBuffer``.

Dispatch uses DeepEP's expand layout: each received token is copied once per local expert
it picked, grouped by expert, so ``recv_x`` feeds the grouped GEMM directly. Combine sums a
token's expert rows on the expert rank, then across ranks. ``cuda_graph_compatible`` picks
whether dispatch syncs with the host:

- False (training, the default): ``do_cpu_sync=True``, so ``recv_x`` has exactly one row
  per (token, local expert) pick.
- True (inference, under no_grad): ``do_cpu_sync=False``, so the MoE forward is
  CUDA-graph-capturable. ``recv_x`` reserves ``num_tokens_per_rank * ep_size * top_k``
  rows; the rows past ``sum(num_recv_per_expert)`` are unused.

Routing scores arrive with the rows (``recv_scores``), and ``RoutedExperts`` multiplies
them into w2's input in plain PyTorch, so autograd handles the score gradient and the
custom ops stay pure communication.
